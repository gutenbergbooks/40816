<h2>IS THE BAR A PROFITABLE PROFESSION?</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Query to be answered during the Long Vacation.</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
<img width="100%" src="images/109.png" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="indent">I am always reluctant to obtrude my personality upon the British
Public. All the world know my address in the Temple, and so long
as my learned friends who act as intermediaries between myself and
the litigation-loving public bear me in mind, I require no further
advertisement. However, I cannot
close my eyes to Duty, and Duty points
to the pages of a paper that may be
aptly called the organ of the Bench,
the Jury, and the Bar. I feel compelled
to publish the following short story in
the columns of that organ as a proof of
the degeneracy of the profession to
which I have the honour to belong. I
shall be only too pleased if my Spartan-like
conduct proves of benefit to my
fellow-counsel. I write in their service,
and without an eye&mdash;yes, I venture to
say half an eye&mdash;to the main chance.
My narrative will prove that ignorance,
and, if I may be permitted to say so,
unpardonable ignorance exists at the
Law Courts. I have kept silent until the Long Vacation has commenced.
My reason for this reticence is not difficult to discover.
Had I taken the public into my confidence at an earlier date, it would
be obvious that I might have suffered in professional status. Now
that the Long Vacation has been reached, there is ample time for the
process known as &quot;living it down.&quot; But I will not anticipate.</p>

<p class="indent">I must confess that I was not a little pleased the other day to learn
from my excellent clerk, <span class="smcap">Portington</span>, that a representative of the
firm of <span class="smcap">Clogs, Judas, and Friars</span>, were anxious to see me on a
matter of business.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I had them as clients before?&quot; I asked my worthy
assistant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, Sir,&quot; returned <span class="smcap">Portington</span>. &quot;You see, for the last
five years you have only had&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; I interrupted, for my excellent clerk is sometimes
inclined to become a trifle prosy. &quot;I will see him at once. Is he in
my room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, no, Sir; as you said that Mr. <span class="smcap">Inkerton</span> might use it for
the soda-water cases, I thought it would be better to show him into
Mr. <span class="smcap">Block&#39;s</span> room. You see, Sir, it is tidier than your room; for
since we have had the lawn-tennis nets&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But here I again interrupted my worthy assistant, who, I am
forced to admit, is sometimes a trifle discursive. I interrupted him,
and, entering <span class="smcap">Block&#39;s</span> room, made the acquaintance of my new
client.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, Sir,&quot; said my visitor, &quot;that you are of opinion that
there is no custom concerning the dismissal of office messengers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I never like to commit myself without referring to my books, so I
was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least,&quot; continued my client, &quot;you have not heard of any?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, no,&quot; I returned; &quot;so far as my experience goes, I have
not come across the custom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s quite enough for us, Sir. If you will swear that, we
shall want nothing further.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rather to my disgust my visitor suddenly placed a <i>subp&oelig;na</i> in my
hand, and told me that the case would most likely be in the list on
the following day. Annoyed at his brusqueness I told him I had been
ready to accept him gratuitously as a client. I added that as I now
found I was only in request as a witness I should require a guinea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; said my visitor, producing the cash. &quot;We looked
you out, and your name is in the <i>Law List</i>; and I see, too, you
have painted it on the door of Mr. <span class="smcap">Block&#39;s</span> chambers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Disdaining to smile at what I considered to be rather a clumsy
attempt at <i>plaisanterie</i>, I bowed, and rang the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we had better have your private address, Sir,&quot; continued
my visitor. &quot;It would be safer, for then we could wire to you when
it came on, and you would be sure to get our telegram.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am always here while the Courts are sitting.&quot; I returned, in a
tone of <i>hauteur</i>; &quot;so you must please wire to me here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as you like, Sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And a few minutes later my clerk saw my visitor safely off the
premises. I admit that I was slightly annoyed at the term &quot;wire.&quot;
It is true that his firm&#39;s name had not appeared&mdash;at any rate,
recently&mdash;in my fee-book, but that was no reason why he should
suggest that I was constantly absent from my chambers. I really
pitied Messrs. <span class="smcap">Clogs, Judas and Friars</span> for having a clerk with so
little tact, and such a small stock of experience.</p>

<p class="indent">On the following morning, when I was standing at the door of the
Carey Street Robing Room, considering whether I should assume my
forensic costume, or enter the Court as a layman, I was accosted by
the same individual, who told me &quot;that we were third on the list.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you will be wanted almost at once, Sir,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I shall be able to come,&quot; I replied, &quot;as, strange to say,
I have no business before their Lordships to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chiefly chamber practice, I suppose, Sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so,&quot; I returned, looking him steadily in the face. &quot;I
mean to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I will not tell a wearisome story of how I had to hang about the
Court until the interval for luncheon, and longer. I will hurry to
the point when I entered the witness-box. To my surprise and secret
satisfaction there was quite a stir when my name was called out.
The Silks in the front row smiled, and my colleagues the juniors
tittered. Even his Lordship looked up with an expression of pleasant
anticipation. I was duly sworn, and gave my name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Sir,&quot; said the Counsel for our side, &quot;tell me. How long
have you known anything about office messengers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I considered for a moment. As a Member of the Bar (although
I had not been asked for my profession&mdash;no doubt that was sufficiently
well known) I desired to set an example. I wished to show
what a witness should be. I desired to appear as a model worthy of
close and universal imitation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen office messengers in offices for many years&mdash;as long
as I can remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I spoke with absolute gravity. To my astonishment there was a
titter which grew into a roar of laughter; even his Lordship found
it difficult to control his cachinnation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the counsel, when he had partially recovered his
gravity. &quot;But, tell me, do you know any custom in connection
with their dismissal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again I considered the matter for a few seconds, and made a second
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I am unaware of any special custom in connection with their
dismissal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time there was no titter. My answer was received at once
with the wildest merriment. The Judge laughed as much as anyone,
and the Usher had to wipe his head with his handkerchief, so
greatly moved was he by his sense of the ridiculous.</p>

<p class="indent">My Counsel sat down convulsed, and had to conceal his face behind
his brief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really don&#39;t think,&quot; gasped out the judge, &quot;that this witness
need be cross-examined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And I was not. As I returned to my seat amidst the smiles of
everyone in Court, a reporter asked me for my Christian name.
Before I could reply, one of my colleagues in wig and gown gave him
what he supposed was the necessary information.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are wrong,&quot; I whispered, and (with a view of crushing
him) handed him my card.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say so,&quot; returned my learned friend; &quot;why, we
thought you were <span class="smcap">Panto</span>,&mdash;the chap you know, who writes as
&#39;<span class="smcap">Yorick</span>&#39; for the <i>Serio-Comic Jester</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And it had come to this! I had been taken, or rather mistaken,
for a humorous contributor! And this after about a quarter of a
century&#39;s service at the Bar! And yet there are those who say that
the profession is <i>not</i> going to the dogs!</p>

<p class="indent">However, I must express my surprise at the conduct of the judge.
It is not ten years since that I had the pleasure of holding a consent
brief before him. And yet he had forgotten me! When the Bench
is so forgetful, how can Silk and Stuff be expected to have better
memories!</p>

<p class="indent">The era of newspaper controversy has once
more begun, and the wail of the letter-writer
is again heard in the land. The guileless
reader may possibly imagine that the letters
he reads so readily are so many brands
plucked from the burning&mdash;in other words,
so many contributions
snatched
out of the Waste-Paper
Basket.
But <i>Mr. Punch</i>
knows better; the
letters are written
where the controversy
begins and
ends&mdash;in the
Newspaper Office.
Why should 85,
Fleet Street lag behind its neighbours in
journalistic controversy? If the largest circulations
have their leader-writers, has not
<i>Mr. Punch</i> his &quot;young men&quot;? The following
letters, therefore, it is frankly admitted,
were written in Fleet Street. Please
notice the careless grace with which &quot;Peckham
Rye&quot; and the &quot;Borough Road&quot; are
thrown in to give an air of &quot;verisimilitude
to a bald and unconvincing narrative&quot; as
<span class="smcap">Pooh Bah</span> said. The subject of the correspondence
gave some small amount of trouble.
&quot;Is Sleeping healthy?&quot; was one suggestion;
&quot;Ought Husbands to kiss their Wives?&quot;
another. Eventually &quot;The Ethics of the
Honeymoon&quot; won by a narrow majority,
after a close division. Of course it need
hardly be said that the subject ought to be
matrimonial. It&#39;s expected of you. The
public look for it. They shall get it. Here
are some of the letters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">THE ETHICS OF THE HONEYMOON.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I desire in your valuable paper
to draw attention to a question which I have
been carefully considering for a great number
of years: Are Honeymoons right? Man and
boy I have been a bachelor these forty years,
and as such have had peculiar and extensive
opportunities for seeing that &quot;most of the
game&quot; which is reserved for outsiders. As
the result of my observation, I confidently
assert that honeymoons are useless, dangerous,
and ought to be abolished. They are useless
in that the only people they profit are the
hotel-keepers. They are dangerous to the
happy pairs, who see enough of one another
in a fortnight to imperil their happiness for a
lifetime. Abolition is clearly the only remedy,
and a Hyde Park Demonstration should settle
the matter.</p>

<p class="center">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Tom E. Rot.</span></p>

<p><i>Peckham Rye.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;However can anyone
ask such a foolish question as &quot;Are Honeymoons
right?&quot; I shall never forget mine.
It was one long dream. We spent the time
in Switzerland and £300 in cash. We&#39;re still
paying interest on the money <span class="smcap">Edwin</span> borrowed
to pay for it. But what of that? The time
we spent was a poem, the recollection of it
is a rapture. Though I should never be
fortunate enough to spend another, I shall
always rejoice in my first honeymoon.</p>

<p class="center">Yours matrimonially,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Angelina Mandoline.</span></p>

<p><i>The Cosy Corner, Swiss Cottage.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I object to honeymoons because
those who take part in them are so unsociable.
What greater disfigurement to a landscape
than a lot of couples honeymooning about?
The whole thing is such a farce, too&mdash;each
would rather speak to some one else, both
are afraid of offending one another. To prevent
anyone thinking I say this because I&#39;ve
been bitten myself, I may add that my first
honeymoon was such a success that next week
I&#39;m going to get married again, and take
another.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Rudyard Kipling</span> has given us in his
own inimitable way a sample of Jungle Law,
which, as he says, is of &quot;immense complexity.&quot;
Now Society is also a Jungle, the
Human Jungle. In it the <i>Bête-Humaine</i>
congregates, for a variety of purposes. Its
laws also are complex, and <i>wonderfully like
those of the Wolves</i> as <i>Baloo</i> gave them in
sing-song. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now this is the Law of the Jungle&mdash;so ancient that no one asks &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must fly,</p>

<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About 9</i> <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Steward&#39;s Room Boy (knocking and entering).</i> Brought you
up some &#39;ot water, Sir, case you&#39;d like to clean up afore supper.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Undershell.</i> I presume evening dress is not indispensable in the
Housekeeper&#39;s Room; but I can hardly make even the simplest toilet
until you are good enough to bring up my portmanteau. Where is it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Boy.</i> I never &#39;eard nothink of no porkmanteau, Sir!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> You will hear a good deal about it, unless it is forthcoming
at once. Just find out what&#39;s become of it&mdash;a new portmanteau, with
a white star painted on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Boy</span> <i>retires, impressed; an interval.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>Boy (re-appearing).</i> I managed to get a few words with <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>,
our second footman, just as he was coming out o&#39; the &#39;All, and <i>he</i>
sez the only porkmanteau with a white star was took up to the
Verney Chamber, which <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> unpacked it hisself.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Then tell <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, with my compliments, that he will
trouble himself to
pack it again immediately.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Boy.</i> But <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>
has to wait at table,
and besides, he says
as he laid out the
dress things, and the
gen&#39;lman as is in the
Verney Chamber is a
wearin&#39; of &#39;em now,
Sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und. (indignant).</i>
But they&#39;re <i>mine</i>!
Confound his impudence!
Here, I&#39;ll
write him a line at
once. (<i>He scribbles a
note.</i>) Here, see that
the gentleman of the
Verney Chamber gets
this at once, and bring
me his answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Boy.</i> What! <i>me</i> go
into the Dinin&#39; &#39;All,
with all the swells at
table? I dursn&#39;t. I
should get the sack
from old <span class="smcap">Treddy</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I don&#39;t care
who takes it so long
as it is taken. Tell
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> it&#39;s <i>his</i> mistake,
and he must do
what he can to put it
right. Say I shall
certainly complain if
I don&#39;t get back my
clothes and portmanteau. Get that note delivered, and I&#39;ll give
you half-a-crown. (<i>To himself, as the Boy departs much against
his will.</i>) So, not content with denying me a place at her table, this
Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> allows her minions to clothe a more favoured guest
at my expense! I&#39;m hanged if I stand it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Dining Hall. The table is oval</i>; <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>is
placed between</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda Cokayne</span> <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brooke-Chatteris</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatteris (encouragingly, after they are seated).</i> Now, I shall
expect you to be very brilliant and entertaining. <i>I</i>&#39;ll do all the listening
for once in a way&mdash;though, generally, I can talk about all
manner of silly things with <i>anybody</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurrell (extremely ill at ease).</i> Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I should say you were
equal to <i>that</i>. But I really can&#39;t think of anything to talk <i>about</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> That&#39;s a bad beginning. I always find the <i>menu</i>
cards such a good subject when there&#39;s anything at all out of the
common about them. If they&#39;re ornamented, you <i>can</i> talk about
them&mdash;though not for <i>very</i> long at a time, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (miserably).</i> I can&#39;t say how long I could go on about
<i>ornamented</i> ones&mdash;but these are plain. (<i>To himself.</i>) I can hear this
waistcoat going already; and we&#39;re only at the soup!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> It <i>is</i> a pity. Never mind; tell me about literary and
artistic people. Do you know I&#39;m rather glad I&#39;m not literary or
artistic myself&mdash;it seems to make people so <i>queer-looking</i>, somehow.
Oh, of course I didn&#39;t mean <i>you</i> looked queer&mdash;but <i>generally</i>, you
know. You&#39;ve made quite a success with your <i>Andromeda</i>, haven&#39;t
you? I only go by what I&#39;m told&mdash;I don&#39;t read much myself. We
women have so many really serious matters to attend to&mdash;arranging
about dinners, and visits, and trying on frocks, and then rushing
about from party to party. I so seldom get a quiet moment. Ah, I
knew I wanted to ask you something. Did you ever know anyone
called Lady <span class="smcap">Grisoline</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> Lady&mdash;er&mdash;<span class="smcap">Grisoline</span>? No; can&#39;t say I do. I know Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, that&#39;s all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> Oh, and <i>she</i> was the original? Now, that <i>is</i> exciting!
But I should hardly have recognised her&mdash;&quot;lanky,&quot; you know,
and &quot;slanting green eyes.&quot; But I suppose you see everybody
differently from other people? It&#39;s having so much imagination. I
daresay <i>I</i> look green or something to you now&mdash;though really I&#39;m
<i>not</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> I don&#39;t understand more than about half
she&#39;s saying. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, I don&#39;t see anything particularly green
about <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt. (only partially pleased).</i> I wonder if you meant that
to be complimentary&mdash;no, you needn&#39;t explain. Now tell me, is
there any news about the Laureateship? Who&#39;s going to get it?
Will it be <span class="smcap">Swinburne</span> or <span class="smcap">Lewis Morris</span>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Never heard of the stakes or the horses
either. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well,
to tell you the truth,
I haven&#39;t been following
their form&mdash;too
many of these small
events nowadays.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt. (to
herself).</i> It&#39;s quite
amusing how jealous
these poets are of one
another! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Is
it true they get a butt
of sherry given them
for it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> I&#39;ve heard
of winners getting a
bottle or two of champagne
in a bucket&mdash;not
sherry. But a
little stimulant won&#39;t
hurt a crack when he
comes in, provided it&#39;s
not given him too
soon; wait till he&#39;s
got his wind and done
blowing, you know.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt.</i> I&#39;m
taking that in. I
know it&#39;s very witty
and satirical, and I
daresay I shall understand
it in time.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, it doesn&#39;t
matter much if you
don&#39;t. (<i>To himself.</i>)
Pleasant kind of woman&mdash;but
a perfect
fool to talk to!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. Chatt. (to herself).</i> I&#39;ve always <i>heard</i> that clever writers
are rather stupid when you meet them&mdash;it&#39;s quite true.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Captain Thicknesse (to himself).</i> I should like her to see that I&#39;ve
got some imagination in me, though she <i>does</i> think me such an ass.
(<i>Aloud, to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.) Jolly old hall this is, with the banners, and
the gallery, and that&mdash;makes you fancy some of those old mediæval
Johnnies in armour&mdash;knights, you know&mdash;comin&#39; clankin&#39; in and
turnin&#39; us all out.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie (to herself).</i> I do trust Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> isn&#39;t saying
something too dreadful. I&#39;m sure I heard my name just now.
(<i>Aloud, absently, to</i> Capt. <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.) No, did you <i>really</i>? How
amusing it must have been!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick. (aggrieved).</i> If you&#39;d done me the honour of payin&#39; any
attention to what I was sayin&#39;, you&#39;d have found out it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> amusin&#39;.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M. (starting).</i> Oh, <i>wasn&#39;t</i> it? I&#39;m so sorry I missed it.
I&mdash;I&#39;m afraid I was thinking of something else. Do tell me again!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick. (still hurt).</i> No, I won&#39;t inflict it on you&mdash;not worth
repeatin&#39;. And I should only be takin&#39; off your attention from a
fellow that <i>does</i> know how to talk.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M. (with a guiltiness which she tries to carry off under
dignity).</i> I don&#39;t think I understand what you mean.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Well, I couldn&#39;t help hearin&#39; what you said to your
poet-friend before we went in about having to put up with partners;
and it isn&#39;t what you may call flattering to a fellow&#39;s feelin&#39;s, being
put up with.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M. (hotly).</i> It&mdash;it was not intended for you. You entirely
misunderstood!</p>

<i>Capt. Thick.</i> Daresay I&#39;m very dense; but, even to <i>my</i> comprehension,
it&#39;s plain enough that the reason why you weren&#39;t listenin&#39;
to me just now was that the Poet had the luck to say somethin&#39; that
you found more interesting.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M.</i> You are <i>quite</i> wrong&mdash;it&#39;s too absurd; I never even met
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> in my life till this afternoon. If you really <i>must</i>
know, I heard him mention my name, and&mdash;and I wondered,
naturally, what he could possibly be saying.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Somethin&#39; very charmin&#39; and poetical, I&#39;m sure,
and I&#39;m makin&#39; you lose it all. Apologise&mdash;shan&#39;t happen again.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M.</i> Please be sensible, and let us talk of something else.
Are you staying here long?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> You will be gratified to hear I leave for Aldershot
to-morrow. Meant to have gone to-day. Sorry I <i>didn&#39;t</i> now.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M.</i> I think it was a thousand pities you didn&#39;t, as you seem
to have stayed on purpose to be as stupid and unkind as you possibly
can.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Can&#39;t say I&#39;m particularly curious&mdash;no affair of

<p class="indent"><i>Lady M. (turning to him).</i> Well, are you as determined to be
disagreeable as ever? Oh, yes, I see you are!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Capt. Thick.</i> I&#39;m hurt, that&#39;s what it is, and I&#39;m not clever at

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>). I say&mdash;I <i>am</i> in a funk. Only just

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cheapness and Light.</span>&mdash;Will some reader kindly inform me
what is the best way of recovering the expenses I have recently been
put to in a <i>most unpleasant</i> Norwegian tour? Norway is said to be
a cheap country, so I think I was not unreasonable in expecting to
be able to see Christiania, Bergen, Trondhjem, and the North Cape,
with all the principal fiords and glaciers, for a five-pound note. But
I was bitterly disappointed. As for the Midnight Sun, it is a complete
fraud, and I should have considered myself lucky if I had seen
a mid-day sun more than once or twice in my tour. Ought not the
companies who advertise for tourists to explain that the Norse mountains
are only <i>half as high as those in Switzerland</i>? Then I was
assured the hotel charges would be only half as high too; but I
found that it was impossible to get supper, bed, and breakfast for
less than half-a-crown anywhere! Comment is needless. I have
just returned home, and find that I have actually spent, during only
three weeks travel, exactly £8 10<i>s.</i> 7½<i>d.</i> I had a <i>miserable</i> crossing

<h2>DOGS&#39; MEET.</h2>

<p class="indent">The annual Canine Congress opened yesterday
in the Isle of Dogs. Should the weather
prove favourable it is expected that the reunion
will be most successful. The Presidential
Address was delivered by <span class="smcap">A. Newfoundland</span>,
Esq., winner of the first prize in
a recent Crystal Palace Show.</p>

<p class="indent">The President, who was received with
general tail-wagging and yelping, observed
that a statement had recently appeared in the
public Press to the effect that there were two
million dogs in the United Kingdom. (<i>Sensation.</i>)
Yes, he was so informed by his
employer&#39;s scullery maid, in whom he had
implicit confidence, as she always acted very
liberally towards him in the matter of bones.
(<i>Applause.</i>) What he wanted to know was,
did all these dogs pay their licences, as they
ought to do? (<i>General barking.</i>) All dogs
who did not pay should be &quot;collared&quot;&mdash;either
by their employers or the police. (<i>Barks and
some dissent.</i>) If there were really two
millions of their race, it could hardly be
denied that the United Kingdom deserved the
title of the true &quot;Dogs&#39; Home.&quot; (<i>Laughter.</i>)
But they had several crying&mdash;he meant howling&mdash;grievances.
In the first place there
were too many mongrels about. (<i>Growls.</i>)
Yes, in their case multiplication was vexation.
(<i>A laugh.</i>) He would put it to the
common sense of the meeting. Obviously
there was only a certain quantity of bones
in the country. Well, the fewer dogs the
more bones would there be for the remainder.
(<i>Barks of assent.</i>) Then, as to the excellent
legal doctrine, the Palladium of their liberties,
that &quot;Every dog may have one bite.&quot; He
was sorry to see that some magistrates had
been inclined to throw doubt on the justice of
this maxim, and he hoped the <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span>
would fly at those magistrates&mdash;he
meant remove them. (<i>Barks.</i>) Another point
to which he must refer was that there was a
tendency to put them off with imported bones.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, <i>he</i> was a Conservative (<i>barks</i>), and he
believed in the good roast beef of Old England.
(<i>Barks and whining.</i>) He regretted,
too, that many employers used an inferior
kind of dog biscuit. (<i>Howls.</i>) If there were
one form of food more repulsive than another
it was the <i>fin de siécle</i> dog biscuit. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
Had it any meat in it at all? (&quot;<i>No.</i>&quot;) Was
it composed chiefly of bad animal fat and
bran? (&quot;<i>Yes.</i>&quot;) There was yet one more
grievance he had to mention. On washing
days (<i>howls</i>) it was sad to think that their
dignity should be lowered by having to submit
to a coat of lather. In this matter some
otherwise excellent employers seemed afflicted
with rabies. (<i>Barks.</i>) He would leave it to
the consideration of the Congress whether a
universal strike against the grievances he had
enumerated should be organised.</p>

the vicinity has also been arranged. Members
of the Congress will be enabled to swim over
to the south side of the Thames, and inspect
the Dogs&#39; Home at Battersea, if the Manager
will admit them. A happy day among the
deer in Greenwich Park is contemplated, and
Barking will of course receive a visit. Altogether,
if the police do not interfere, a
thoroughly enjoyable outing is anticipated.</p>

<h2>THE CURSE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The Spectre arose with a menacing look,</p>
<p>He called not for candle, for bell, or for book,</p>
<p>But in terrible tones, growing gruffer and gruffer,</p>
<p>He solemnly cursed that deluded Old Buffer!</p>
<p>He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed,</p>
<p>From his buniony feet to his shiny bald head;</p>
<p>He cursed him in sleeping, that every night</p>
<p>He should dream about burglars and wake in a fright;</p>
<p>He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking,</p>
<p>With troubles dyspeptic and feelings of &quot;sinking&quot;;</p>
<p>He cursed him in walking, in running, in flying,</p>
<p>In puffing and panting, in freezing and frying,</p>
<p>With horror of living and longing for dying.</p>
<p>He banished him harshly from home, couch, and cook,</p>
<p>His favourite chair, and his best-beloved book;</p>
<p>From afternoon snooze, and from snug evening smoke,</p>
<p>From old-fashioned &quot;rubber,&quot; and elderly joke;</p>
<p>From pottering round in his trim-bedded garden,</p>
<p>From down-at-heel slippers, old coat, and churchwarden;</p>
<p>Condemned him to dress in swell togs void of ease,</p>
<p>To hurry and scurry, to crowd and to squeeze;</p>
<p>To horrible burdens and journeys of length,</p>
<p>Exceedingly trying to temper and strength;</p>
<p>To puff like a porpoise, to pant and perspire,</p>
<p>To doing&mdash;<i>whatever he didn&#39;t desire</i>!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Never was heard such a horrible curse!</p>
<p class="i4">But what may give rise</p>
<p class="i4">To some little surprise,</p>
<p>This curse, at which courage may shiver and shake,</p>
<p>It only condemned the Old Buffer to take</p>
<p>His Annual Holiday!! <i>What can be worse?</i></p>

<h2>ROBERT ON AMERRYCANS.</h2>

<p class="indent">What grand fellers them Amerrycans is!
I have allers admired em since I fust made
aquaintence with the real Gent as I used to
wait upon at the Grand Otel at Cherring

a reel Gent if ever
there was one!</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I was
atending upon jest
such another gent
at quite a grand
Party the other
night; and, when
it was all over, the
principle Gennelman
came up to
me and interduced
me to him as an
Amerrycan Gent
as wanted to speak
to me, and he then
acshally told me
as how as my little
Book was about
one of the most populerest in all the United
States! And he then arsked me how many
copies we had sold? And when I thort as I
shoud estonish him by telling him as I beleeved
as it was sumthing about seventeen
thowsend, he said as how as that was nothink
to what he should have xpected, for a hunderd
thowsend would not have surprised him! for
he had bin told as how as one of their werry
leadingest men, I rayther think as he said it
was the Pressident, or a great friend of his
whenever he was a good deal bothered about
State matters, allers called for a copy of
&quot;Robert,&quot; for it was quite sure to put him
all to rites again, and send him to bed with a
jolly larf!</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I thort as this was all pritty well,
but he acshally finished up by arsking me
whether I coudent write another wollum jest
like the other! for he was sure as any of their
grate Publishers coud sell any quantity of
em! speshally if they thort it woud take the
shine out of the Englisher by saying it was
by <span class="smcap">Washingham</span>! He then introjuced me
to another Amerrycan, and asked him what
he thort of his plan? To which he replied
that he didn&#39;t know much about publishing,
but he was quite sure there was nothink in
that or in any other matter in which an Amerrycan
coud not lick all creation! And then
they both went away larfing!</p>

<p class="indent">Tho what there was to larf at in such a
werry serious matter as they had bin a torking
about I&#39;m sure I cant make out, the
more so as I ain&#39;t heard a single word from
em since, and even thinks it werry possible
as I never shall.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange to say I had a most wunderful
dream that night! I dremt as I was reelly in
Amerrykey, and having a long conwersation
with a reel live Publisher all about an Amerrycan
&quot;Robert&quot;! and jest as we was aranging
all about the price, and the number of
Wolumes, and the way he was to send me
all the money, I suddenly woke, and found
myself a lying by the side of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert</span>!
